Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), the non-profit entity behind Let's Encrypt, is pleased to announce our collaboration with <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a>. The Linux Foundation will provide general and administrative support services, as well as services related to fundraising, financial management, contract and vendor management, and human resources.

The Linux Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing Linux and collaborative development. Founded in 2000, The Linux Foundation sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds and is supported by leading Linux and open source companies and developers from around the world.

While ISRG and Let's Encrypt are not specifically oriented towards Linux, we share an enthusiasm for solving problems with open and collaborative initiatives. The Linux Foundation hosts a variety of projects that embrace open source and collaborative development practices and principles, ranging from Yocto Project (embedded Linux) to AllSeen Alliance (Internet of Things) and Cloud Foundry (Platform-as-a-Service). It also hosts the <a href="https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>, which identifies and funds critical open source projects that support the worldâ€™s infrastructure. This was established in response to Heartbleed a year ago and is today funding important work to ensure a secure Internet. 

ISRG's collaboration with The Linux Foundation will allow our staff and management to focus on carrying out our mission. While we do so, we'll be supported by a team at The Linux Foundation with a wealth of experience helping similar organizations. Furthermore, sharing support infrastructure with other projects allows us to put more of our donors' money directly towards carrying out our mission.
